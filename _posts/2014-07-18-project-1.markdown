description: Timefall Development has seen a great amount of evolution with respect to our original mission and vision. We started out as a group that was just interested in creating Minecraft mods for our friends and we have since grown into a pillar of the Minecraft Modding Community and a source of education for many new developers. As such, our mission has become one of education and encouragement for developers, both new and seasoned, not only within the Minecraft Modding Community, but across the coding and computer science ecosystem. Every project that we undertake is open source and is provided in a manner that encourages people to learn from and be able to ask questions in order to become the best developer they want to be. Timefall Development also believes that community is the foundation to any organisation and this includes those who make use of the software that we produce. We would not be who we are if we didnâ€™t have the amazing community that we have today and they drive us to always be better than we were yesterday.
